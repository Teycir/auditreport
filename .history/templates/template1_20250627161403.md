## Summary & General Analysis

This report summarizes the findings of a security audit on the [Project Name] protocol. The codebase demonstrated a solid foundation, but several vulnerabilities related to access control and interaction patterns were discovered. The primary areas of concern involve reentrancy, insecure owner privileges, and missing input validation.

### Approach

My audit process included:
- **Manual Review:** I conducted a thorough line-by-line review of all in-scope contracts to understand the core logic, identify potential attack vectors, and check for deviations from best practices.
- **Conceptual Analysis:** I focused on the economic incentives and systemic risks inherent in the protocol's design.
- **Tooling:** I used static analysis tools like Slither and wrote targeted fuzz tests using Foundry to verify hypotheses and uncover edge-case vulnerabilities.

> Approximately **XX hours** were spent on this audit.

### Systemic Risks & Centralization Concerns

- **Privileged Owner Role:** The `owner` address has the unilateral power to pause all contract functions and change critical fee parameters without a timelock. A compromised owner key could lead to a temporary freeze of funds or exploitation via fee manipulation.
- **Oracle Dependency:** The protocol relies on a single price feed for a core asset. If this oracle were to be deprecated, manipulated, or fail, it could lead to incorrect pricing and allow for the draining of protocol funds.
